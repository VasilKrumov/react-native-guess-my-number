## Repository Description

The **React Native Guess My Number** repository is an open-source project hosted on GitHub. It provides a mobile app developed using the React Native framework. The app is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

The repository contains all the necessary source code, assets, and configuration files to build and run the Guess My Number app. It follows best practices and conventions for developing React Native applications and provides an intuitive and interactive user interface.

## Usage Guide

To use the React Native Guess My Number app, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Node.js: The app requires Node.js to run JavaScript code outside the browser. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. Expo CLI: The app utilizes Expo, a development toolchain built around React Native. Install the Expo CLI globally on your machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

### Installation

To install and set up the app, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VasilKrumov/react-native-guess-my-number.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-native-guess-my-number
   ```

3. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can run the app on either a simulator/emulator or a physical device.

#### Running on a Simulator/Emulator

To run the app on a simulator/emulator, follow the steps below:

1. Start the simulator/emulator of your choice. You can use Android Studio for Android emulation or Xcode for iOS simulation.

2. Run the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the Expo development server and display a QR code in the terminal.

3. Use the camera app on your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal. This will open the app in Expo Go, the official Expo client app.

### Gameplay

Once the app is successfully running on your device, you can start playing the Guess My Number game. Here's a brief overview of how the game works:

1. The app will generate a random number between 1 and 100.

2. You need to enter a number in the input field and tap the "Confirm" button to make a guess.

3. The app will provide feedback on your guess, indicating whether the target number is higher or lower.

4. Use this feedback to refine your guesses until you successfully guess the correct number.

5. The app will keep track of the number of rounds it took to guess correctly.
